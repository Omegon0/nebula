Description: Today I started with the Flappy bird as a template. I came up with a set of modifications I could use to "convert" the Flappy bird into Nebula, starting with removing gravity. 

Description: Today, I worked on understanding the flappy bird code. I first started with the timing system, because that's critical to the game I'm planning. I also changed the code for the gamepad, so that the D pad determines the motion of the flappy bird. You can see the feature I added here: ![screenshot](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/b303bc5ad8b4182826b5c055fef192bb0481c226_89564.png).
